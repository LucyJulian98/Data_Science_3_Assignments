For full credit, code must be free of semantic errors, be written with liberal comments, include meaningful variable names, and use control structures to minimize repetition (three or more instances of nearly identical statements. NOTE: There is an empty cell after each problem. This does not mean that all code for a given section must be placed in one cell. You may use as many cells as you would like for each section."
